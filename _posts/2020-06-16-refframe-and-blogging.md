### So, you said Refframe?
Long story short: **`Refframe is an exploration platform meant to facilitate the navigation through the cloud of scientific content.`**
Nothing more. The name is a contraction of Reference Frame and summarises the idea behind my project: utilising the references contained by scientific publication to better catalogue and frame them.
### My problem and the idea
During my time in academia, I realised that while doing research, everybody was doing two things to find new scientific content to read:

1. Use one of the many search engines existing on the internet, enter a few keywords and look for interesting documents
2. Look within the references of an interesting article to find more relevant materials to read or relevant authors.

##### Ok, and what's wrong with that?
This process is long, tedious and its outcome often incomplete. I thought that there might be a better way of doing things and minimise the burden placed on the human - which was me, back then. Why would not the search engine perform most of this heavy lifting and present me a report?

The traditional way of doing document search relies on lexical indexations and document similarity measures. While this approach works well for non-specialised material where nuances and specific contexts are often of little concern, it seems to fail to deliver satisfying answers in the context of scientific publications. 

To all this, I would add the fact that for some reasons, we choose to store a wide portion of mankind's knowledge in a non easily minable data format: PDF documents (we will come back to those soon enough...)

##### And so?
So I thought that I could put something together, make my life easier, and ideally open it to more people along the way. I had experience with programming and I (still) liked solving problems, so why not give it a good wack and knock this one out of the way.

That was five years ago, and today it is still not - fully - solved. It was naive of me to think that it would be an "easy" thing to do, but while the journey has been much longer than anticipated, I have come to know what I do not know; and also actually learned a few things along the way.

### This blog
Lately, I have reached a point where I could make incremental additions to my system. I have also reached the point where I had to look back and wonder if it was still worth pushing forth. I reached the conclusion that:

1. Yes, I would still like to finish what I have started...
2. ...But I would like to share it with more people.

This is why I start today this blog that I will (mainly) dedicate to my journey building Refframe.  It might not be the best way to share what I want but, 
as usual, *I have no idea what I am doing, but I am doing it anyway.*
