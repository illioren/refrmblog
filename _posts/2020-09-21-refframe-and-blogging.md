### So, you said Refframe?
Long story short: **`Refframe is an exploration platform meant to facilitate navigation through the cloud of scientific content.`**
The name is a contraction of Reference Frame and summarises the idea behind my project: utilising the references contained by scientific publications to better catalogue and frame them.
### My problem and the idea
During my time in academia, I realised that while doing research, everybody was doing two things to find new scientific content to read:

1. Use one of the many search engines existing on the internet, enter a few keywords and look for interesting documents.
2. Look within the references of an interesting article to find more relevant materials to read or relevant authors.

##### Ok, and what's wrong with that?
Completing this process by hand is long, tedious and its outcome often incomplete. I thought that there might be a better way of doing things and minimise the burden placed on the human - which was me, back then. Why would not the search engine perform most of this heavy lifting and present me a report?

The traditional way of doing document search relies on lexical indexations and computing a document match score against the search query. While this approach works well for non-specialised material where nuances and specific contexts are often of little concern, it seems to fail to deliver satisfying answers in the context of scientific publications. 

To all this, I would add the fact that for some reasons, we choose to store a wide portion of mankind's knowledge in a non easily minable data format: PDF documents (I will come back to those in the near future...)

##### And so?
So I thought that I could put something together, make my life easier, and ideally open it to more people along the way. I had experience with programming and I liked solving problems, so why not give it a good wack and knock this one out of the way.

That was five years ago, and today it is still not - fully - solved. It was naive of me to think that it would be an "easy" thing to do, but while the journey has been much longer than anticipated, I have come to know what I do not know; and also actually learned a few things along the way.

### This blog
Lately, I have reached a point where I could make incremental additions to my system. I have also reached the point where I had to look back and wonder if it was still worth pushing forth. I reached the conclusion that:

1. Yes, I would still like to finish what I have started...
2. ...But I would like to share it with more people.

This is why I start today this blog: not for advertising, but to share my experience, et and more importantly, my failures. We too rarely keep those to ourselves and prevent others from learning from them.

It might not be the best way to share what I want but, 
as usual, *`I have no idea what I am doing, but I am doing it anyway.`*
