# They said "Success is Easy":

So, the [first prototype](https://illioren.github.io/refrmblog/refframe/journey/first%20prototype/2020/10/05/your-first-prototype/) was created. I was ["sort of" working](https://illioren.github.io/refrmblog/refframe/journey/first%20prototype/2020/10/12/the-first-prototype/). The problem was solved, right? I mean the solution is sub-optimal, but all is left is to refine it until it is not.

Plus, there are so many topics that I find fascinating out there: Machine learning, code optimisation, Neuroscience, Graphs, general programming, video games, astronomy, astrophysics, etc... I am sure that I even find an interest in listing the things I am interested about.

The best part? From the outside, they all look great, shiny and full of opportunities. Everyday a lot of great people are pictured doing great things in those fields -in almost all fields, let's be fair.

I reckon that the so portrayed persons could fit into two categories: the truly great ones that have learned to self-promote and ... the ones that are made into great ones.

Now, do not misunderstand, I am not calling "scam" here, nor pointing out any type of inequality. This is not my point at all. This is a point about the system we live in. Indulge me for a minute:

- Anything that is visible is visible because it distinguishes itself from the background noise of information we are constantly exposed to.
- What distinguishes itself from that noise does not necessarily do so because it is a qualitative outlier, but because it is made to be distinguishable through active promotion (being word-of-mouth sharing, advertising, etc...).
- Nobody admires flaws or failure. Some people like to witness it, but rarely to engage with it positively. Hence, we never promote failure, always successes and against-the-odds outcomes. Everybody likes a good rags-to-riches story.
- Ergo, we only see what is good, what is bad is hidden. Since what we see builds our norm, we tend to think that the norm is success and success is due.

In the end, it all comes down to selling: people want to sell for a -maximized- profit; and you will not sell a defective looking product, you will not sell something hard to adopt, you will not sell if your clients have to work for it. 

This applies to more than the people incensed by the success stories here. this covers the entire system that supports said reports: there exist wide economic incentives to promote success stories, to sell excitement, and to lower the barrier to entry to the product. This means making its use and adoption (look) easy. But when the product is, indeed, simply ***Success***, that means promoting its ubiquity and ease of reach. 

In short, `"Success is Easy"`.
